= Try, Catch and Finally

Camel supports the Java equivalent of try ... catch ... finally directly in the DSL.
It aims to work like its Java sisters but with more power.

In Camel, we prefix the keywords with `do` to avoid having same keyword as Java.
So we have:

- `doTry`
- `doCatch`
- `doFinally`
- `end` to end the block in Java DSL

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using `doTry ... doCatch ... doFinally` then the regular Camel
xref:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler] is not in use; meaning any
`onException` or the likes does not trigger.

The reason is that
`doTry ... doCatch ... doFinally` is in fact its own error handler and mimics how try/catch/finally works in Java.

=== Using onWhen with doCatch

You can use xref:predicate.adoc[Predicate]s with `doCatch` to make it runtime determine if the block should be triggered or not.
In our case, we only want to trigger if the caused exception message contains the *damn* word.

=== Use end() to end the block

Notice when using Java DSL we must use `end()` to indicate where the try ... catch ... finally block ends.
As the example above has a finally, then the `end()` should be at the end of the finally block.
If we are not using a finally, then the `end()` should be at the end of the `doCatch`
to indicate the end there.

TIP: Instead of `end()` you can use `endDoTry()` to end and _return back_ to the try ... catch scope.

=== Using nested doTry ... doCatch EIPs

When nesting `doTry ... doCatch` from an outer `doTry ... doCatch` EIP,
then pay extra attention when using Java DSL as the Java programming language is not _indent aware_
so you may write Java code
that is indented in a way where you think that a catch block is associated with the other doTry, but it is not.

Given the following Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:test").routeId("myroute")
    .doTry().
        doTry().
            throwException(new IllegalArgumentException("Forced by me"))
        .doCatch(Exception.class)
            .log("docatch 1")
            .throwException(new IllegalArgumentException("Second forced by me"))
    .doCatch(Exception.class)
        .log("docatch 2")
    .end();
----

Then you may think that `_docatch2_` is associated on the outer doTry because of how the code is formatted.
But it is **not**, both `_docatch1_` and `_docatch2_` are in the inner `doTry`, and the outer `doTry` has no catch blocks.

So in this example, the route will throw the first exception which is then handled in `_docatch1_`
which then throws a second exception, that is not caught.

So what you must do is to end the doCatch block correct (notice how we use `endDoTry()` two times) as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:test")
    .doTry().
        doTry().
            throwException(new IllegalArgumentException("Forced by me"))
        .doCatch(Exception.class)
            .log("docatch 1")
            .throwException(new IllegalArgumentException("Second forced by me"))
         .endDoTry() // end this doCatch block
     .endDoTry() // end the inner doTry
    .doCatch(Exception.class)
        .log("docatch 2")
    .end();
----

And by using the `endDoTry()` we can end the block correctly, and an XML or YAML representation of the route would be as follows:

    <from uri="direct:test"/>

                <log message="docatch 1"/>
